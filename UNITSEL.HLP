Metric / Imperial System
------------------------

BEAT provides the ability to accept input data in the metric system as well as
in the imperial system. Default is the imperial system. Output will always be
in the imperial system.

Measurement data entered into the spec library always must be in imperial units.
Since the program always displays default values when requesting input data,
this option may also be used to quickly convert such data between the two unit
systems.
