Reflection Analysis
-------------------

This program calculates the reflection coefficient given the load
impedance (Zl) and the line impedance (Zo).  

The reflection coefficient (p) output is that for the voltage change. 

The equation used is as follows:

p = (Zl - Zo)/(Zl + Zo)

For example, given the falling edge of a voltage waveform changes -3.0v at
the source, the voltage change at the load would be -3.0v + (p * -3.0v).  If
p = -0.33, then the voltage step at the load would be -2.0v.
